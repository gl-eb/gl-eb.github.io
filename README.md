This repository hosts my personal website, which can be found under https://www.glebsite.ch/

Version 1 (currently serving as the lecture notes section) was built with my very rudimentary webdesign skills. Currently, the landing page is made using R markdown and the [postcards package](https://github.com/seankross/postcards).
