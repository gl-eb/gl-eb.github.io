This repository hosts my personal website, which can be found under <https://www.gl-eb.me/>

## History

- Version 1 was built with my very rudimentary webdesign skills.
- For version 2, I build a landing page using R markdown and the [postcards package](https://github.com/seankross/postcards) while retaining version 1 as a subpage to house my lecture notes
- Version 3 is a complete rebuild using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)
