# glebsite
This website is for my personal use and for now only houses my lecture notes, that I provide to other students of ETH Zurich. It can be found under www.glebsite.ch

Version 1 is built with my very rudimentary webdesign skills. I am currently trying to learn more about HTML and CSS and plan to expand and improve the website. In the future, I might also learn about further web technologies and implement those here.
