This repository hosts my personal website, which can be found under <www.glebsite.ch>

Version 1 (currently serving as the lecture notes section) was built with my very rudimentary webdesign skills. Currently, the landing page made using R markdown and the (postcard package)[https://github.com/seankross/postcards].
