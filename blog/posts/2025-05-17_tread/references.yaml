  abstract: >-
    A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready for analysis,
    but there has been little research on how to make data cleaning as easy and
    effective as possible. This paper tackles a small, but important, component
    of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model
    and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column,
    each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table.
    This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set
    of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This
    structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis,
    tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a
    consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case
    study free from mundane data manipulation chores.
