## Bio

My name is Gleb Ebert and I am a doctoral student in the [evolutionary microbiology group](https://evomicrobio.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich. I am interested in fundamental aspects of microbial evolution, which I aim to investigate using experimental evolution and genomics approaches.

Throughout my bachelor studies in biology, I compiled notes for many of my lectures. They can be found [here](pages/lecture_notes.html).

I also enjoy [photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/glebebert/) and [birding](https://ebird.org/profile/MTc5NDAwMg/CH), even though I don't manage to go out often.
