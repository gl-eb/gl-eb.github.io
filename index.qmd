I am a doctoral student in the [evolutionary microbiology group](https://evomicrobio.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich. I am interested in fundamental aspects of microbial evolution, which I aim to investigate using experimental evolution and genomics approaches. In particular, my PhD research concerns with the upper limits of thermal adaptation of *Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis*, an antarctic marine bacterium.

I also enjoy [photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/glebebert/) and [birding](https://ebird.org/profile/MTc5NDAwMg/CH), even though I don't manage to go out often.
