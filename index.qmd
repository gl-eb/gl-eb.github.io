I am a doctoral student in the [evolutionary microbiology group](https://evomicrobio.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich.
I am interested in fundamental aspects of microbial evolution such as evolvability, which I investigate using both wet and dry lab approaches including experimental evolution, genomics and transcriptomics.
In particular, my [PhD research](science/index.qmd#evolvability-of-bacteria-in-changing-environments) concerns with the upper limits of thermal adaptation of *Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis* TAC125, an Antarctic and thus cold-adapted strain of a globally distributed marine bacterium.

I enjoy coding and data visualisation, doing so primarily in R and from time to time Python.
I have written about some of my projects on my [blog](blog/index.qmd) and the source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/gl-eb).

In my free time I like to observe and photograph birds.
I was first exposed to birding while growing up and dabbled in it on and off over the years, but only started birding more seriously in 2020.
My interest in photography also started out because of birds, though I have had landscape and sports photography phases.
