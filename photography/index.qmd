At age 14 a family friend gave me his old compact camera, a Pentax Optio 555.
About a year later, during which I was taking photos in full-automatic mode
only, a colleague of my father's taught me the basics of how cameras work, how
to compose images and how to edit them.
This new found knowledge enabled me to appropriately use the Optio 555's aperture
and shutter-priority modes.
I also found my new favourite subjects: Birds (see @fig-tern for one of the
first pictures I took of a bird).

Next christmas, I got a Nikon D3100 kit with 18-55mm and 55-105mm lenses.
Over the next few years I started dabbling in landscape and sports photography.
The former was mainly motivated by a lack of big lens, making bird photography
difficult (@fig-reeds, @fig-hasliberg).
The latter came from my own years as rower during high school (or Gymnasium,
as we call it in Switzerland; @fig-basel-head).

the german flag.
The rowers are part of the german national rowing team.
In the background one of Basel's reaction ferries can be seen."

Nowadays, my focus (pun intended) has mostly switched back to bird photography.
While I certainly have much to learn, I am encouraged by the progress at the
same time (@fig-european-robin, @fig-common-eider).
Currently I use a Nikon D7200 body and the Tamron SP 150-600mm F/5-6.3 Di VC
USD G2 for wildlife photography.
