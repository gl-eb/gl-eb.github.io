## Evolvability of Bacteria in Changing Environments

The model organism I worked with during my PhD with Macarena Toll-Riera in the [evolutionary microbiology group](https://evomicrobio.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich in Switzerland (though most of the group has recently moved to the [Institute of Evolutionary Biology](https://www.ibe.upf-csic.es/evolutionary-microbiology-group) in Barcelona, Spain), is *Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis* TAC125 (*Ph*TAC125), an Antarctic strain of a globally distributed marine bacterium.
In particular, we used this cold-adapted strain to study the evolvability of bacteria in the face of rising temperatures.
Because temperature is a complex stressor which has a broad genetic basis of adaptation, we lack an in-depth understanding of what determines the ability of organisms to adapt to heat.
While a number of eukaryotic organisms as well as the mesophilic, i.e. intermediate temperature-adapted, gut bacterium *Escherichia coli* have received most attention in this regard, the same cannot be said for environmental and in particular cold-adapted microbes.
To change this, Macarena performed an evolution experiment in which populations of *Ph*TAC125 were allowed to adapt to increasing temperatures [@toll-rieraLimitEvolutionaryRescue2022].
Over the course of 900 generations, the upper thermal limit, which is the highest temperature at which replication occurs, increased from the wild-types 29°C to 30°C.
My doctoral research was concerned with the question of why the evolvability of the upper thermal limit is constrained to 1°C.

In a first project I looked for signs of adaptative gene expression changes in the evolved clones.
Despite a higher upper thermal limit, the transcriptomes remained in a highly stressed state.
Furthermore, each of the analysed clones evolved unique solutions to heat stress despite a high degree of parallel genome evolution.
A particularly striking example of parallel genome evolution in the earlier evolution experiment was a particular insertion in the *lon* gene, which encodes an important quality control protease.
To investigate its role in high-temperature-adaptation I performed an evolution experiment.
Surprisingly, populations descending from a partial *lon* deletion strain showed a fitness benefit at intermediate temperatures.
However, this advantage disappeared as mutant *lon* alleles rose to fixation in populations which originally carried a wild-type *lon* allele.
Finally, to push the upper thermal limit beyond the previously established 30°C, I used clones with increased mutation rates (hypermutators) from the evolution experiment performed by Macarena [@toll-rieraLimitEvolutionaryRescue2022].
In addition, I implemented an fluctuating temperature regime, which enabled both hyper- and non-mutator populations to adapt to growth at 32°C, 2°C above the previously established upper limit.

## Bachelor and Master in Biology

During my bachelor's studies biology at ETH Zurich, Switzerland, I developed a broad interested in microbiology and evolution.
Microbial pathogens in particular peaked my curiosity with their ability to outwit a complex multicellular organism's immune defenses.
My fascination was strengthened by laboratory courses, leading me to major in microbiology and immunology during my master's studies.

For a first three month rotation project I worked with Bidong Nguyen in [Wolf-Dietrich Hardt's group](https://micro.biol.ethz.ch/research/hardt.html) on the molecular mechanisms of *Salmonella* Typhimurium pathogenesis.
Through knock-outs and *in vivo* experiments we investigated the importance of a number of genes on the ability of *Salmonella* Typhimurium to colonise the mouse gut.

Later I joined [Bruce McDonalds group](https://path.ethz.ch/) for a second three month rotation project to work on *Zymoseptoria tritici*, a fungal pathogen of wheat.
Under the supervision of Cécile Lorrain I phenotyped a large collection of natural isolates in regards to their ability to cope with a panel of abiotic stressors using automated image analysis.
Then, I performed a GWAS to find genetic variants underlying the phenotypic diversity.

For my Master thesis, again working with Cécile Lorrain, I ran an evolution experiment adapting *Z. tritici* to increasing fungicide concentrations.
In particular we aimed to find the limits of adaptation to two fungicides from different classes and investigate how the genomes of the six ancestral strains evolved over time.
We also performed *in planta* phenotyping of virulence of ancestral and evolved strains.
