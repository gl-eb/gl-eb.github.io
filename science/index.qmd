## Evolvability to Environmental Change

I am currenlty working on my PhD with Macarena Toll-Riera in the [evolutionary microbiology group](https://evomicrobio.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich in Switzerland (though most of the group has recently moved to the [Institute of Evolutionary Biology](https://www.ibe.upf-csic.es/evolutionary-microbiology-group) in Barcelona, Spain).
My main scientific interest lies in the evolvability of bacteria.
To his end I work with *Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis* TAC125 (*Ph*TAC125), an Antarctic and thus cold-adapted strain of a globally distributed marine bacterium.
Macarena Toll-Riera performed an evolution experiment in which *Ph*TAC125 was adapted to slowly increasing temperatures [@toll-rieraLimitEvolutionaryRescue2022].
While the upper thermal limit of the ancestral strain only increased from 29°C to 30°C, genome sequencing uncovered widespread parallel evolution.
The most remarkable example being that over 90% of the sequenced clones carried a mutant allele of the *lon* gene, which encodes the Lon protease, and most of the mutant alleles turned out be the the exact same one.
All of my doctoral research is a direct continuation of this experiment.

For example, I investigated the transcriptomes of both *Ph*TAC125 as well as a panel of high-temperature-adapted clones from the aforementioned evolution experiment across a range of temperatures.
In particular, we were interested in the transcriptional response of *P. haloplanktis* to heat stress and how adaptation to high temperatures might have changed it.
Interestingly, we found that the heat shock response is similarly active in both ancestral and evolved clones at their respective upper limits.
Furthermore, we did not see the high levels of parallel genome evolution translating to parallel transcriptome evolution.

At the same time we also wanted to find ways around the previously determined upper thermal limit at 30°C.
To do so we performed further evolution experiments.
In a first we directly continued the original experiment by choosing evolved clones with increased mutation rates, so called hypermutators, and adjusting the experimental design to introduce fluctuating levels of selection.
By doing so, we successfully pushed the upper thermal limit further up to 32°C.
Interestingly, hypermutator populations consistently grew to higher optical densities throughout the experiment.

In a second evolution experiment I used both the natural isolate *Ph*TAC125 as well as a *lon* knock-out strain to investigate the role that the Lon protease plays in adaptation to high temperatures.
The hypothesis that the frequently selected for mutation resulted in an evolutionary bottleneck which prevented adaptation to temperatures beyond 30°C could not be confirmed.
While we did see *∆lon* populations grew to higher densities at temperatures below 29°C, the difference disappeared as we reached 30°C without surpassing the previously established upper limit further.

## Bachelor and Master in Biology

During my bachelor's studies biology at ETH Zurich, Switzerland, I developed a broad interested in microbiology and evolution.
Microbial pathogens in particular peaked my curiosity with their ability to outwit a complex multicellular organism's immune defenses.
My fascination was strengthened by laboratory courses, leading me to major in microbiology and immunology during my master's studies.

For a first three month rotation project I worked with Bidong Nguyen in [Wolf-Dietrich Hardt's group](https://micro.biol.ethz.ch/research/hardt.html) on the molecular mechanisms of *Salmonella* Typhimurium pathogenesis.
Through knock-outs and *in vivo* experiments we investigated the importance of a number of genes on the ability of *Salmonella* Typhimurium to colonise the mouse gut.

Later I joined [Bruce McDonalds group](https://path.ethz.ch/) for a second three month rotation project to work on *Zymoseptoria tritici*, a fungal pathogen of wheat.
Under the supervision of Cécile Lorrain I phenotyped a large collection of natural isolates in regards to their ability to cope with a panel of abiotic stressors using automated image analysis.
Then, I performed a GWAS to find genetic variants underlying the phenotypic diversity.

For my Master thesis, again working with Cécile Lorrain, I ran an evolution experiment adapting *Z. tritici* to increasing fungicide concentrations.
In particular we aimed to find the limits of adaptation to two fungicides from different classes and investigate how the genomes of the six ancestral strains evolved over time.
We also performed *in planta* phenotyping of virulence of ancestral and evolved strains.
