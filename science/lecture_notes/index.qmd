Throughout my bachelor studies in biology at ETH Zurich, I compiled notes for many of the lectures.
They are in the language the course was taught in and are provided as is (i.e. no guarantee of completeness or correctness).

:::{.callout-note}
Only the newest version of each set of notes is available.

:::{.callout-warning}
The lecture notes provided here were compiled as part of the 2013 study programme of the Bachelor in Biology at ETH Zurich.
In 2020, a new study program was introduced which came with changes to lectures.
