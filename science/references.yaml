    Climate change is gradual, but it can also cause brief extreme heat waves
    that can exceed the upper thermal limit of any one organism. To study the
    evolutionary potential of upper thermal tolerance, we evolved the
    cold-adapted Antarctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis to survive
    at 30°C, beyond its ancestral thermal limit. This high-temperature
    adaptation occurred rapidly and in multiple populations. It involved genomic
    changes that occurred in a highly parallel fashion and mitigated the effects
    of protein misfolding. However, it also confronted a physiological limit,
    because populations failed to grow beyond 30°C. Our experiments aimed to
    facilitate evolutionary rescue by using a small organism with large
    populations living at temperatures several degrees below their upper thermal
    limit. Larger organisms with smaller populations and living at temperatures
    closer to their upper thermal tolerances are even more likely to go extinct
    during extreme heat waves.
